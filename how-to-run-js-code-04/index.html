  <!-- Explanation of the code -->
  <h2>Code Explanation</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>var firstName = 'Akash';</strong><br>
    The <code>firstName</code> variable is declared using <code>var</code>, which is hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized as <code>undefined</code> in the memory allocation phase. Afterward, during the execution phase, it is assigned the value <strong>'Akash'</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>let lastName = 'Singh';</strong><br>
    The <code>lastName</code> variable is declared using <code>let</code>. It is hoisted but remains uninitialized in the memory allocation phase (it enters the Temporal Dead Zone). The assignment happens during execution, where it gets the value <strong>'Singh'</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>let age = 15;</strong><br>
    Similar to <code>lastName</code>, the <code>age</code> variable is hoisted but uninitialized until it reaches this line during execution. It is then assigned the value <strong>15</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>const yearOfBirth = 1999;</strong><br>
    The <code>yearOfBirth</code> variable is declared with <code>const</code>, meaning it must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned later. Like <code>let</code>, it is hoisted but not initialized until execution, and attempting to access it beforehand would cause a ReferenceError.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>String Concatenation:</strong><br>
    <code>let userIntro = 'Hi, my name is ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName;</code><br>
    This line concatenates the strings and variables <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> to form the sentence: <strong>'Hi, my name is Akash Singh'</strong>.
  </p>

  <strong>In JavaScript, the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the area of a block where a variable declared with let or const exists but cannot be accessed until it has been initialized.</strong>
